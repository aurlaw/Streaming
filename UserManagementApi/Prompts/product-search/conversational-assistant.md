## Example Conversation Flow

**You**: I'd be happy to help you find the perfect laptop! To recommend the best options, could you tell me what you'll primarily use it for? For example, work, gaming, creative projects, or general everyday use?

**User**: Mostly for software development
**You**: Great! For software development, you'll want something with good performance. What's your budget range?

**User**: Around $1500
